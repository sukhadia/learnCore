Coding exercise for LearnCore.

## Notes:

### Randomization code: 
  * Done in JavaScript. 
  * HTML file created to show both solutions
  * Two solutions: 
    * One script meets requirements: random.js
    * Other included in case it's interesting: random2.js (a path I went down based on the pattern of the sample input/output
      before understanding "uniformly randomized" and before realizing that the output of this algorithm was always the same!)
    
### SQL: answers.sql

### Object Design: 
  * Game of choice: Connect 4
  * Combination of Java and JavScript syntax
  * Number of objects small but included properties, methods and notes on logic
